# Plugin Development
To develop a plugin, you need to meet the following requirements:
1. Basic knowledge of Python
2. Ability to parse JSON using Python
3. Familiarity with CQ codes is beneficial
4. ...
A template for plugin development can be found in the `PluginTemplate` folder within the repository. The essential files are:
- `Plugin.json`: Contains information about the plugin, such as its name, dependencies, and configuration.
- `<MainPyName>.py`: The main Python file for the plugin, without the `.py` extension. This file should not contain any variable assignments to `__name__`.

## Plugin Configuration
The `Plugin.json` file holds key-value pairs that configure the plugin's behavior. It must include the plugin name, main Python file name, and other parameters like author and description. The `DependentLibraries` field is optional and specifies any third-party libraries required by the plugin. If `AutoInstallLibraries` is set to `true`, these libraries will be automatically installed.

## Plugin API
Various APIs are available for use within plugins, such as `FloraPath`, `SendMsg`, and others mentioned in the documentation. These can interact with FloraBot's core features or send messages via HTTP or WebSocket protocols.

### Example Usage
An example of using the `SendMsg` API to send a message or event is provided in the documentation. Additionally, utilities like `BroadcastEvent` allow for inter-plugin communication based on the OneBot protocol.

### Path Handling
When working with file paths, it is recommended to use the `ThePluginPath` variable provided by FloraBot, which ensures the correct relative path from the location of `FloraBot.py`. This approach avoids issues with manually defined paths and works reliably across different platforms.

By following these guidelines and utilizing the available APIs, you can create functional and interactive plugins for FloraBot. Always remember to test your plugin thoroughly to ensure compatibility and reliability within the FloraBot framework.
