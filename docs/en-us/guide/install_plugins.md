::: tip
You can [develop](../develop/plugin_develop.md) your own plugins or search for plugins in the [Plugin List](./plugin_list).
:::
**Upon first startup, a folder named 'FloraBot' will be created. Navigate into this folder, then into the 'Plugins' subfolder. Place the plugin folder inside the 'Plugins' folder. If it is compressed, decompress it before placing it.**  
**Directory structure example:**  
```File
FloraBot
 /-Plugins
    |-Plugin Folder
    |  |-Plugin.json
    |  \-Plugin.py
    \-Another Plugin Folder
       |-Plugin.json
       \-Plugin.py
